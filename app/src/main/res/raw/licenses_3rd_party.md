We consider fair use of the included meme templates.

We don't own any of these unless other specified. If one or more meme template (/font) violates copyright laws and
you want them to be removed, please send a mail to the maintainer and they will get
removed as soon as possible from MemeTastic. Note that memes are pretty sure free
advertisments for what's in the picture (so for you or your company or products).
